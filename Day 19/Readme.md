# Turtle Race Betting Game

## Introduction
This Python program is a simple turtle racing game that allows users to place bets on a turtle and watch the race unfold. The game utilizes the Turtle graphics library for creating the graphical interface and animating the turtles.

## How to Play
1. Run the program.
2. A window will appear, prompting the user to choose a turtle to bet on.
3. Enter the color of the turtle you want to bet on when prompted.
4. The race will start, and the turtles will move forward randomly.
5. The race ends when one of the turtles reaches the right side of the window.
6. The program will announce the winner and whether the user's bet was successful.

## Code Overview
- The code uses the `turtle` library to create a window and turtles for the race.
- Turtles are created for each color (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple).
- The turtles start at the same position on the left side of the window.
- The turtles move forward at random speeds in each iteration of the race loop.
- The race ends when one of the turtles reaches the right side of the window.
- The program checks if the user's chosen turtle is the winner and prints the result.

## Code Structure
- Turtles and their initial positions are set up.
- The user is prompted to choose a turtle to bet on.
- The race loop begins, moving the turtles forward until a winner is determined.
- The program prints the result of the race, indicating whether the user won or lost.
- The game window can be closed by clicking on it.

## Usage
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Copy and paste the provided code into a Python file (e.g., `turtle_race.py`).
3. Run the script using a Python interpreter.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to choose a turtle and watch the race.
