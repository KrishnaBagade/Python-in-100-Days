Caesar Cipher Program
This is a simple implementation of the Caesar cipher in Python. 
The program allows users to encode or decode a message by shifting the 
letters of the alphabet. It handles both uppercase and lowercase letters
while preserving non-alphabetic characters.

Features
Encryption and Decryption: Choose to either encode or decode your message.
Shift Number: Specify the shift number for the encryption or decryption
process.
Alphabet Preservation: Non-alphabetic characters are preserved in the
final result.
Usage
Run the program by executing python caesar_cipher.py in your terminal
or command prompt.
Choose to 'encode' or 'decode' your message.
Enter your message.
Provide a whole number as the shift number.
Review the encoded or decoded result.
Choose to run the program again or exit.
