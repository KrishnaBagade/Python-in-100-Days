# Hirst Painting with Turtle

This Python script utilizes the Turtle graphics library to create a visually appealing grid of dots with random colors. Each dot is placed on the canvas, forming a 10x10 grid. The colors are randomly selected from a predefined list of colors provided in the `Color_Used` module.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. The code uses the Turtle graphics library, which is typically included with Python installations.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dot-grid-turtle.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd dot-grid-turtle
    ```

3. Run the script:

    ```bash
    python dot_grid.py
    ```

4. Click on the Turtle graphics window to close it when you are done.

## Customization

If you want to modify the colors or any other parameters, you can do so in the `Color_Used` module or directly in the main script (`dot_grid.py`). Feel free to experiment with the code to create different patterns or effects.

```python
# Example modification of Color_Used module
# Color_Used.py

v = [
    # Your list of colors here
    (255, 0, 0),    # Red
    (0, 255, 0),    # Green
    (0, 0, 255),    # Blue
    # ...
]
```
